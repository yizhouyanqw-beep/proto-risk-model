# proto-risk-model
A lightweight, simulation-driven risk-scoring framework for prototype device security

Overview

Proto-Risk-Model is a modular risk-scoring framework designed to evaluate the security exposure of hardware prototype devices during their end-to-end lifecycle — including manufacturing, transit, internal testing, demo usage, field trials, and device retirement.

This project focuses on quantitative risk modeling inspired by financial engineering principles (exposure modeling, factor decomposition, Monte-Carlo simulation) and applies them to prototype device IP protection, supply-chain integrity, and operational security.

This repository is intended as a research + engineering side project, and can serve as:

a reproducible risk modeling baseline

an analyzable framework for internal security policy tuning

a demonstrative evidence package for NIW use cases (risk quantification, industry relevance, national interest topics)
